MLH Fellow - Habit Tracker Project 
Helping users keep track of their daily habits! 

Inspiration
Tried of constantly falling back into your bad habits? Want to break out of it and create good habits? The habit tracker keep tracks of your daily habits through manual input by the user. This way, the user can get a visualization of how often their habits occur and may motivate themselves in breaking out of their bad habits and into good ones. 

What it does
Users can begin interacting with the tracker through the top input section to the left of the adjacent circular blue plus button. There, user can add whichever habit they would like to track. Once adding the habit, users can increment or decrement the habit based on the amount of times that habit action has occurred. A chart will display to create a visualization of the different habits performed by the user.
